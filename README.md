entering the customer ID load up the customers data in the first textfield, so does the media code input do for the media data. Add to cart button adds it to the customers "Cart" arraylist, and the "Proceed to Checkout" button adds all the objects found in the cart arraylist for the customer to their "Rented" arraylist.
